# Dataset Governance Report

## SVACS Unified Core

### Dataset Governance Maturity Validation

---

# Overview

This report validates the governance maturity layer implemented for SVACS Unified Core.

The governance framework ensures deterministic handling of dataset lineage, trust visibility, approval continuity, schema authority validation, provenance-safe governance enforcement, and federated dataset registry compatibility.

The governance layer was expanded to support operational maritime intelligence substrate readiness.

# Governance Objectives

The governance system validates:

* dataset ownership visibility
* deterministic trust classification
* provenance-safe dataset lineage
* schema authority continuity
* approval state validation
* validation status enforcement
* dataset lifecycle visibility
* federated registry compatibility
* governance-safe replay continuity
* immutable governance references

# Governance Validation

The governance validator successfully validates:

* required governance fields
* trust score continuity
* schema authority visibility
* governance structure integrity
* deterministic governance enforcement
* replay-safe governance continuity

Validation Command:

```bash
python governance/dataset_governance_validator.py
```

Validation Result:

```text
DATASET_GOVERNANCE_VALID
```

# Dataset Governance Example

```json
{
  "dataset_id": "AIS_FEED_001",
  "dataset_owner": "SVACS",
  "dataset_trust_score": 92,
  "dataset_origin": "AIS",
  "approval_state": "APPROVED",
  "validation_status": "VALID",
  "dataset_expiry_policy": "90_days",
  "federated_registry_reference": "SVACS_REGISTRY",
  "dataset_change_log": [],
  "source_confidence": "HIGH",
  "schema_authority_reference": "SVACS_GOV_SCHEMA_V1"
}

# Governance Guarantees

The governance system guarantees:

* deterministic governance continuity
* replay-safe dataset validation
* immutable governance lineage
* provenance-safe governance reconstruction
* schema authority visibility
* audit-safe governance handling

---

# Governance Boundary Enforcement

The governance layer prevents:

* silent dataset mutation
* unauthorized schema drift
* hidden provenance changes
* replay governance corruption
* trust score manipulation
* governance bypass conditions

---

# Governance Integration

The governance framework integrates with:

```text
SIGNAL
→ PERCEPTION
→ INTELLIGENCE
→ STATE
→ REPLAY
→ DASHBOARD
```

Governance metadata remains visible across replay reconstruction and lineage continuity validation.
